# DVE-2017-0013: (fixed) České Radiokomunikace a.s. CDN nameservers sets AD bit on every response

A CDN service provided under `*.cdn.cra.cz.` DNS tree is delegated to
`sr01.cdn.cra.cz.` and `sr02.cdn.cra.cz.` nameservers.  The
authoritative servers are also setting `AD` bit on in all DNS
responses violating
[RFC 4035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4035#section-3.1.6)

### DNS Response for non-authoritative zone with AD bit set

```
$ dig +norec +noedns IN A example.com. @sr01.cdn.cra.cz.
; <<>> DiG 9.10.3-P4-Debian <<>> +norec +noedns IN A example.com. @sr01.cdn.cra.cz.

## Proposed fix

České Radiokomunikace a.s. are strongly advised to properly implement
DNS protocol to ensure the interoperability between DNS
implementation.  Clear the `AD` bit in the authoritative answers,
while [RFC 4035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4035#section-3.1.6)
allows usage of `AD` bit in an Authoritative Response, this doesn't
seem to be a case of design decision, but simply an implementation
error.
