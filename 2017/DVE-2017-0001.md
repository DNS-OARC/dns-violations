# DVE-2017-0001: KMPMedia nameservers returns garbage at the end of the packet

## Description

Nameservers ns{1,2,5,6,7}.kmplayer.com. returns \x00-filled bytes after the last
RRSet violating [RFC1034](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt)
Section 4.1. creating malformed DNS messages.

## Evidence

### dig +dnssec IN A log.kmplayer.com. @ns1.kmplayer.com.

``` 
 ;; Got bad packet: FORMERR
 69 bytes

## Proposed fix

The aforementined nameservers MUST NOT create malformed packets by
adding \x00 filled bytes after the last RRSet in the DNS message.

## Workaround

DNS Implementations are advised to have a relaxed parser that will
just ignore garbage at the end.
