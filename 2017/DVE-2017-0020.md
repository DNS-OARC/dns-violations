# DVE-2017-0020: Some Qwest DNS servers return an incorrect response to unknown EDNS options in request

## Description

*sauthns1.qwest.net* and *sauthns2.qwest.net* DNS servers respond incorrectly to EDNS requests that contain
any option unknown to them (for example a *COOKIE* option).

[Section 6.1.1 of RFC 6891](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6891#section-6.1.2) says that:
>  Any OPTION-CODE values not understood by a responder or requestor MUST be ignored.

These servers, however, respond with an RCODE of *BADVERS* instead.

Many .GOV domains (like *archives.gov*, *arts.gov*, *bea.gov*, etc.) are served by these DNS servers.
This breaks resolving them by *BIND* 9.10.3+ on Windows and *BIND* 9.11.0+ on all systems since these resolvers
add a *COOKIE* option to every DNS query by default.

This problem was noticed as early as in [March 2014](https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dnsext/current/msg13683.html).

## Evidence

### EDNS with *COOKIE* option

```sh
$ dig +edns +cookie +norecurse archives.gov soa @sauthns1.qwest.net
; <<>> DiG 9.11.0-P3 <<>> +edns +cookie +norecurse archives.gov soa @sauthns1.qwest.net
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: BADVERS, id: 63779
;; flags: qr ad; QUERY: 0, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

```

```sh
$ dig +edns +cookie +norecurse archives.gov soa @sauthns2.qwest.net

```

### EDNS without options

```sh
$ dig +edns +nocookie +norecurse archives.gov soa @sauthns1.qwest.net
; <<>> DiG 9.11.0-P3 <<>> +edns +nocookie +norecurse archives.gov soa @sauthns1.qwest.net

```

## Proposed fix

The problem may be caused by an outdated version of *NSD: Name Server Daemon* from *NLnet Labs* being used on these DNS servers
(version 3.2.2 from May 2009).

The DNS server software should be patched or upgraded - a vendor page says that:
> NSD 3.x is end of life. We now provide support for NSD 4. Please upgrade to NSD 4.

## Workaround

Disable EDNS or attaching of any EDNS options to a DNS query by a resolver when interacting with these DNS servers (if possible).

## DNS Operator/Vendor Response

Operator was notified October 13, 2017 via *ipadmin@centurylink.com* address
(after *dns-admin@qwestip.net* address found in SOA records returned an automatic response that that mailbox is no longer available).

When a reply is received this entry will be updated.
