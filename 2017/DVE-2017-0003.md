# DVE-2017-0003: McAfee nameservers silently break when 0x20 randomization is used

## Description

The 0x20 technique is used to randomize upper/lower case in outgoing
queries lowering the attack surface by adding more random bits to the
communication when matching the incoming DNS answer for the same
capitalization in the QNAME section.

The McAfee CDN nameserver local.cloud.mcafee.com. fails to ignore
uppercase in the incoming queries and silently failing with NXDOMAIN
when some components of QNAME has been switched to uppercase violating
[RFC1034](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt) Section 3.1.

## Evidence

### All lowercase

```
$ kdig +dnssec IN A b-0.19-23003008.1481.1518.19cf.3ea1.410.0.ekzijnekvvvg7gb38qcwur561b.avqs.mcafee.com. @local.cloud.mcafee.com

### Upper case in the fourth label (from root)

```
$ kdig +dnssec IN A b-0.19-23003008.1481.1518.19cf.3ea1.410.0.ekzijnekvvvg7gb38qcwur561B.avqs.mcafee.com. @local.cloud.mcafee.com

```

## Workaround

The DNS Implementations are advised to have a configurable
0x20-blacklist, where the DNS Resolver Operator can add bad
actors.

## Proposed fix

McAfee CDN nameserver is advised to lowercase all incoming DNS queries
when looking up the data for DNS answer, but preserve the case in the
outgoing DNS message, see [RFC1034](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt)
Section 3.1:

> By convention, domain names can be stored with arbitrary case, but
> domain name comparisons for all present domain functions are done in a
> case-insensitive manner, assuming an ASCII character set, and a high
> order zero bit.  This means that you are free to create a node with
> label "A" or a node with label "a", but not both as brothers; you could
> refer to either using "a" or "A".  When you receive a domain name or
> label, you should preserve its case.  The rationale for this choice is
> that we may someday need to add full binary domain names for new
> services; existing services would not be changed.
