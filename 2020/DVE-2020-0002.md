# DVE-2020-0002: mail.protection.outlook.com nameservers fail to serve SOA data

## Description

The zone mail.protection.outlook.com has two nameservers:

```
$ dig +dnssec +short ns mail.protection.outlook.com
ns1-proddns.glbdns.o365filtering.com.
ns2-proddns.glbdns.o365filtering.com.
```

Queries to these nameservers using EDNS0 fail as detailed in DVE-2020-0001.
Queries to these nameservers without EDNS for the mail.protection.outlook.com/SOA RRset result in a NODATA response.

[RFC 1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035) section 4.2.1 specifies:

  > Though logically part of the authoritative data, the RRs that describe the top node of the zone are especially important to the zone's management.  These RRs are of two types: name server RRs that list, one per RR, all of the servers for the zone, and a single SOA RR that describes zone management parameters.

Bizarrely, the NODATA response returned includes an SOA RR in the AUTHORITY section of the response.  This may result in a recursive resolver caching the SOA RRset at trust level 3 (see [RFC 2181](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035) section 5.4.1) then immediatey replacing that cached RRset with a NODATA RRset due to it being more trustworthy.

## Evidence

Evidence is provided here for one nameserver.  Both nameservers behave in the same way.

## Proposed fix

Nameservers should respond with the SOA RRset in the ANSWER section when queried for the SOA RRset.

## DNS Operator/Vendor Response

It has not been possible to contact the vendor.
